Other things such as fade-ins can also be added for extra movement. *Since this is a Japanese site, the image text is also in Japanese*",

Therefore I took it upon myself to create a brand image sheet for this brand.(Current page:https://www.rakuten.ne.jp/gold/vieo/)",

      "The ballet Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is one of my favorite ballets, and therefore I wanted to make a mock-up for it. This time my keywords were: Whimsical, chaotic, fun, and the main colors were red and purple. I wanted the background to be a photo, and I wanted a logo of the royal ballet, as well as the title of the ballet in the design. In terms of design I wanted to re-create that slightly chaotic feeling that is portayed in the ballet, yet I wanted to still keep the design clean and easy to understand. Since the goal was a poster that could be enlarged and put on for example billboards, too much of a messy design and the message would easily be lost. →",

      "→ I decided it would be easiest to get that chaotic feeling with typography. In the ballet there is a stage background where different letter are spread out all over the background. I really liked the chaotic feeling it gave and wanted to do something similar, but spreading out the title to much would make it unreadable. I therefore decided to only do the wonderland part, randomizing the font and size, while still keeping it aligned for readability. Behind the title I added the shapes of a labyrinth referencing the very confusing journey she has to go through in Wonderland. I also added the crown and hearts to reference the queen of hearts, although I made some of the hearts purple to reference the journey Alice does to save her own love. I made the colors very saturated to give that playful but also dreamlike feeling the ballet has. It goes on theme with how the ballet also works with strong colors in their stage and custome design.",

    description:
      "Designing advertisement is a balance between visually pretty and informative. If an advertisement has too many design elements or too much text the customer may not understand the overall message. At the same time, if an advertisement is visually displeasing, then the customer may have a bad first impression of the company. Then there is the company branding to consider. Any graphic created for the company must be in line with the visual brand. For this ad I used brighter colors to portray the warmth of coffee and meeting people that is associated with a café. It also fits perfectly with the pop feeling of the logo. Despite the pop colors the rectangle shapes stops it from looking too childish. This way it fits perfect for the target user of young adults.",

Both these covers are based on novels I am currently writing. The one to the left is a novel based on North Mythology, and follows a woman who becomes a warrior of Valhalla after her death. The novel to the left is of the mystery and supernatural genre, the plot revolving around ghosts. Therefore I choose a more still portrait, layering a photo of frost to give it an old and chilling effect perfect for a ghost story.",

I continue like that until I find words that I think correctly represents the organization. Then I draw by hand as many logo designs I can think about. When I am truly exhausted of ideas, I choose about four or five drawings that I really like. Those are the ones that I will design in Illustrator. I will try different shapes, colors, and just play around until I am completely satisfied with what I have. Then if I have client, I will send them my four or five favorite designs for feedback. I believe that in this stage showing designs in context is important(for example, creating a photo of a business card or a sign using the logo). Then after the client feedback, I will do the adjustments necessary.",
