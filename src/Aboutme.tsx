          <h3>Wilma Yasuda</h3>
          <p>
            I'm a Frontend student at IT-HÃ¶gskolan in Gothenburg. I have also
            former experience working with Frontend development/ Graphic Design/
            UX/UI Design in Japan, where I lived for 14 years.
            <br /> <br />
            As a Web Developer, the languages I most commonly use are HTML5,
            CSS(Sass), and Javascript. I also have experience using react.js as
            well as C#.
            <br /> <br />I am currently looking for LIA(work practice) fall
            2027, as well as spring 2028. Feel free to contact me if you know
            anyone interested in having a Frontend student contribute to their
            company.
