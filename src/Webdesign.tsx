              Considering that the products are knitted items with the target
              user being Swedish parents, an outdoor fall and winter setting
              felt quite natural to me. Sweden is a country with long winters
              and below zero degree weather. Most children play and move around
              all day, often outside, therefore it is important to show that
              these clothes are of good enough quality that they can stand
              tougher conditions. Not only by text, but through pictures as
              well. <br />
              <br />
              As backed up by the User Research I conducted, it appears that
              many parents nowadays prefers more muted colors for their kids
              clothes, as opposed to vivid baby colors. That combined with the
              outdoor setting gave me the idea to make the key word for this
              brand Natural. Therefore I added to the visual concept a selection
              of natural colors that I believe could be found in a fall or
              winter outdoor setting. <br />
              <br />
              Lastly, I added the rectangle, triangle, and circle shape to give
              the visuals a sense of playfulness and fun that I think is
              important for a children's brand. <br />
